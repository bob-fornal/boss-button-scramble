# boss-button-scramble

This is an open-source project to develop a means of quickly scrambling off a particular site so that others do not see what is actually being viewed.

The concept is to allow "victims" a means to hide the site they are viewing.

## Concepts

* **TRACKS**: Two development tracks

    1. Site-Addon Button
    2. Chrome Plugin
    
* **DISPLAY**:

    * Look into Google and limiting the number of results (default search to be displayed, differenct search, different site).
    * Overlay (delayed 10 second default versus defined).
    
* **BUTTONS**: Button placement: Fixed Banner (header, footer, left, right), Button assigned to defined element

    This should have a fixed pattern to make the "Scramble" button easy to find across various sites.
    
* **KEYBOARD**: Key sequence (default versus defined).
